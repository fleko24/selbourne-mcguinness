                <p className="text">    
                    At Shelbourne & McGuinness we strive for excellence. Our cabinets are produced from high quality Egger melamine sheets, solid wood veneers or furniture grade birch plywood using the very latest CNC machinery.
                    <br/><br/>
                    This system ensures absolute precision in cabinet construction as well as allowing infinite variation in cabinet size. Most of our cabinets would offer 10% more storage space than comparable mass produced examples,as well as allowing us to offer deeper drawers and lower plinth heights.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We source finished doors from several Irish companies as well as offering a complete made to measure option where the customer has complete control of the finished look of the kitchen.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We use all our experience to ensure the quality of the hardware we offer with our kitchens and it is sourced from reputable companies.
                    <br/><br/>
                    All the attention to detail that goes into a Shelbourne & McGuinness kitchen ensures that each kitchen will last a lifetime.
